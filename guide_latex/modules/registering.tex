\subsection{Registering}

You can register for courses by visiting \url{https://mypurdue.purdue.edu}, under the registration tab. Select the School term you need and if required enter the Registration PIN Verification, which is usually "999999".

For late registration or for courses that require the instructor's permission you need to fill a course-request form (Form-23), which you can get from the CS Graduate Office (LWSN 1137). After completing the form and have your instructor/advisor sign it, you need to take it to the Registrar's Office in the lowest level of Hovde Hall, Room 45.

You should be able to verify your registered classes through \url{https://mypurdue.purdue.edu}.
