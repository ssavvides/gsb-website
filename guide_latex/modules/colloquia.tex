\section{Colloquia}

Some of the biggest names in computing will visit Purdue while you are here. Some of the visitors are big-names-to-be. When they visit, you want to attend these talks. Some will be boring, some will be incomprehensible, but they will give you a view of computing and current research that you probably can't get any other way. You might even get an idea for a research topic from the talk.

The current faculty sometimes give talks, including CS590 and CS690 seminars. Again, this is a good way to get exposure to some interesting research and faculty here at Purdue. Although you may wonder about it sometimes, the CS faculty here at Purdue is one of the best in the country. Take advantage of your time here to hear what they think is interesting.

If a faculty search is on for the year, there will be lots of faculty candidate talks in the spring semester. Attendance at these talks is beneficial both to you and the department. The department takes into consideration feedback from students when making a hiring decision, so please attend these talks and give your feedback to a GSB representative after candidate-student meetings which will be announced at least a week in advance.
